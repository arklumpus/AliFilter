# AliFilter API

This folder contains source code files and examples showing how to use AliFilter models in various programming languages (C#, C/C++, JavaScript, Python, R). The JavaScript implementation can be also used from [AlignmentViewer](https://giorgiobianchini.com/AlignmentViewer/AlignmentViewer.html).

**Note**: the C# library is the "official" implementation; other programming languages are provided only as a proof-of-concept. In particular, current implementations in languages other than C# do not support bootstrap replicates and only apply the "fast" model settings.
